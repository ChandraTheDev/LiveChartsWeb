<h3>Styling</h3>

<p>
    A chart from LiveCharts inherits from WPF User Control, this means that you can style a chart
    practically as you normally would with any other control, like setting a Background, a Font or
    Horizontal alignment, in this article we are only going to focus on changing the unique properties
    from this library. Next image shows the chart we are building.
