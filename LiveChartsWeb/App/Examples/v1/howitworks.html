<h3 class="doc-title">How it Works</h3>

<p>
    Live Charts core components are SeriesCollection class and IChartValues interface, both of them
    implements INotifyCollectionChanged interface, so they are able to notify the chart when you add/remove
    a series or a value from each series.
</p>

<p>
    Any chart by default is ready to plot double values and scale them in the Y axis, but there is really easy
    to invert a chart to scale on X or plot any type you need instead of only double values, see examples section.
</p>

<h4>Is Live Charts performance safe?</h4>

<p>
    Yes, we use a concept that we call DataStep, a DS (DataStep) is a short interval
    when a chart listens for changes, when this interval finishes then the chart is updated, so you can update a large
    amount of points and the chart will only update once (when DS ticks).
</p>

<h4>Tracking Changes</h4>

<p>
    LiveCharts tracks your chart changes in two different ways, primitives and complex. both methods could show
    a different animation.
</p>

<p>
    When you plot primitive types, normally double values, the only way we can track the animation is by the position of the
    point in the array, primitive tracking is ok if you don't need to change first and mid points, or if you don't care about
    animations.
</p>

<p>
    This short example will examplin the issue, lets create a LineChart with some values as follows:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
var values = new ChartValues&lt;double&gt;{ 2, 5 };
</pre>

<p>
    In the next image, every time we click "+" we add a new random value at the end of the array, when we click "-"
    we remove the firstr item.
</p>

<p>
    When we click "+" the animation runs correclty because LiveCharts is able to detect that there is a new position in the chart,
    before addind the point we had 0, 1 positions and after we add it we have 0, 1, 2.
</p>

<p>
    Sadly when we remove the first point, before removing we had 0, 1, 2 positions and after we have 0, 1 so for LiveCharts
    We removed the last point and moved the value of the zero position.
</p>

<p>
    The next animation shows the issue.

<p>
    On the other hand, complex tracking will always display the desired animation since it tracks by instance id, not
    only the poition in the array
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
var values = new ChartValues&lt;MyClass&gt;{ new MyClass(), new MyClass() };
</pre>
