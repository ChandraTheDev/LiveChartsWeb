<h3 class="doc-title">Labels</h3>

<p>
    A Label is any string representation of any value in the chart, they are normally placed
    over the axis length and in tooltips.
</p>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/App/Examples/Images/labels.png"/>
</div>

<p>
    There are 2 types of labels in LiveCharts, Formatted and Mapped labels.
</p>

<h4>Formatted Labels</h4>

<p>
    A Formatted label is useful when there is a direct conversion between the chart value and the label,
    for example, in the image above, the Y axis has a range of values between 8 and 26, but because of the
    current formatter, we are able to see <i>8</i> as <i>8.00k items</i>.
</p>

<p>
    This is really easy to achieve, the <a href="#/documentation/axis?search=labelformatter">Axis.LabelFormatter</a>
    property, stores a function that takes a double value as parameter and returns a string, LiveCharts will
    use this function every time it needs to display a chart value as string.
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
MyAxis.LabelFormatter = val => val.ToString("C"); //as currency
MyAxis.LabelFormatter = val => val + "°"; //as degrees
MyAxis.LabelFormatter = val => val + ".00 items sold"; //or any other custom format
</pre>

<h4>Mapped Labels</h4>

<p>
    A mapped label is normally useful to map a position with a name, for example when first point belongs to John
    second to Susan and third one to Charles.
</p>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/App/Examples/Images/mappedlabels.png"/>
</div>

<pre class="prettyprint">
barChart1.AxisX.Labels = new List&lt;string&gt;() {"John","Susan","Charles"};
</pre>

<p>
    To show an example we are going to talk about an X indexed chart, this does not mean you cannot label Y
    axis, to Label a Y axis you would normally need to invert the chart first.
</p>

<p>
    Axis.Labels type is IList&lt;string&gt;, and by default X axis is indexed, this means first point is 0,
    second is 1, third is 2... and so on, this means and both x values and IList share an index for each position.
</p>

<p>
    So when x = 0 then label will be Axis.Labels[0], when x = 1 Labels[1], x = 2 then labels[2],
    x = n then labels[n].
</p>

<p>
    Notice that if X index is greater  than Labels.Count an empty string will be returned.
</p>

<p>
    Axis.Labels hides Axis.LabelFormatter, mean while Axis.Labels is not null then labels will be pulled from
    Axis.Labels, if Axis.Labels is null then LiveCharts will use the formatter, if both are null then the raw
    value will be used as label.
