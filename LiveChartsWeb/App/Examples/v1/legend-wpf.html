<h3 class="doc-title">Chart Legend</h3>

<p>
    A legend contains a list of the series appearing in the chart, you can place it at Left, Bottom, Top or Right.
</p>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/App/Examples/Images/legend.png"/>
</div>

<p>
    All you need to place a legend is set the <a href="#/documentation/chart?search=legendlocation">LegendLocation</a>
    property to a certain position
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;PieChart LegendLocation="Right"&gt;&lt;/lvc:PieChart&gt;
</pre>

<p>
    You can also create your own legends control, All you need to do is create a new user control that inherits from
    LiveCharts.ChartLegend, you can also see <a href="https://github.com/beto-rodriguez/Live-Charts/tree/master/LiveChartsCore/Legend">included chart legend</a> 
    to help you build your own.
</p>


<p>
    After your legend is ready you need to set it to your chart:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
myChart.ChartLegend = new myLegendControl();
</pre>
