<h3 class="doc-title">Styling</h3>

<p>
    A chart from LiveCharts inherits from WPF User Control, this means that you can style a chart
    practically as you normally would with any other control, like setting a Background, a Font or
    Horizontal alignment, for more information see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.usercontrol(v=vs.110).aspx">WPF User Control Class</a>
